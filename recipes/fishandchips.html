<p>Recipe for the loved British dish: Fish and Chips.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    For the fish:
    <li>7 tbsp (55 g) all-purpose flour, divided</li>       
    <li>7 tablespoons (55 grams) cornstarch</li>        
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>        
    <li>Sea salt, to taste</li>        
    <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>        
    <li>1/3 cup dark beer, cold</li>        
    <li>1/3 cup sparkling water, cold</li>        
    <li>4 (7-ounce) fish fillets (thick, white fish)</li>        

    For the Chips:
        
    <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled</li>        
    <li>1 quart (1 liter) vegetable oil , or lard, for frying</li>        
        
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the remaining flour with the cornstarch and baking powder. Season lightly with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper. </li>
    <li>Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the sparkling water to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for between 30 minutes and 1 hour. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide chips. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under cold running water. </li>
    <li>Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. </li>
    <li>Drain carefully through a colander, then dry with paper towels. Keepin the fridge covered with paper towels until needed. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season lightly with a little sea salt. </li>
    <li>Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep-fat fryer or large, deep saucepan. Cook the chips a few handfuls at a time in the fat for about 2 minutes. Do not brown them. Once the chips are slightly cooked, remove them from the fat and drain. Keep to one side.</li>
    <li>Place the 2 tablespoons of flour reserved from the batter mix into a shallow bowl. Toss each fish fillet in the flour and shake off any excess.</li>
    <li>Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.</li>
    <li>Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully lower each fillet into the hot oil. Fry for approximately 8 minutes, or until the batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets from time to time with a large slotted spoon.</li>
    <li>Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Cover with greaseproof paper (parchment paper) and keep hot.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips until golden and crisp, or about 5 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain. Season with salt. </li>
    <li>Serve immediately with the hot fish accompanied by your favorite condiment.</li>
